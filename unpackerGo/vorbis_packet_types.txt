Vorbis Packet Types (from RFC 3533 and Vorbis I specification):

The Vorbis bitstream contains three header packets followed by audio packets:

1. Identification header (packet type 1):
   - First packet in the logical bitstream
   - Contains basic codec information
   - Format: [01] + "vorbis" + version + channels + sample_rate + bitrates + block_size_info + framing_bit

2. Comment header (packet type 3):
   - Second packet in the logical bitstream
   - Contains metadata/comments
   - Format: [03] + "vorbis" + vendor_string + user_comments + framing_bit

3. Setup header (packet type 5):
   - Third packet in the logical bitstream
   - Contains codec setup information (codebooks, etc.)
   - Format: [05] + "vorbis" + setup_data + framing_bit

4. Audio packets (packet type 0):
   - All subsequent packets
   - Contains compressed audio data
   - Format: [0] + audio_data

Note: Packet types must be odd for header packets and even for audio packets.
Header packets: 1, 3, 5
Audio packets: 0 (or any even number, but typically 0)

Our files show packet type 3, which suggests we're looking at the comment header, not the identification header.
This means the identification header (type 1) should come before this packet.
